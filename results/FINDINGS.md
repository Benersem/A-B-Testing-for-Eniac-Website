## A/B Testing Results and Analysis

### Summary of Findings

The Chi-Squared test revealed a significant difference in the performance of the four versions, suggesting that at least one version performed significantly better or worse than the others. To further investigate these differences, post hoc tests were conducted to compare specific pairs of versions.

### Key Results:
- **Version C** showed a statistically significant difference in the click-through rate when compared to **Version B** and **Version D**.
- No significant difference was found between **Version C** and **Version A**.

### Conclusion:
Given these results, it is challenging to declare a clear winner solely based on statistical analysis, as both **Version C** and **Version A** demonstrated strong performance. Therefore, we can conclude that these two versions are the most successful in terms of click-through rate.

### Recommendations:
For a definitive decision on which version should be featured on the website, it is recommended to consider additional factors such as:
- Other performance metrics (e.g., conversion rates, user engagement)
- Qualitative feedback from users
- Expert opinions
- Potentially redesigning and re-running the experiment to gather further insights
