## 🔍 Problem Statement
The primary goal of this A/B test is to optimize the "SHOP NOW" button by testing different variations (A, B, C, D) and measuring their impact on CTR.

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The button design does not significantly affect CTR.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** At least one design leads to a statistically significant increase in CTR.

## 📊 Data & Methodology
1. **Randomized User Assignment**: Visitors are randomly assigned to one of four button variations.
2. **Data Collection**: Clicks and total visits are recorded.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: A/B test is performed using a **Chi-Square Test** and **Post Hoc Test**.
4. **Visualization**: CTR comparison using bar charts and funnel visualizations.
